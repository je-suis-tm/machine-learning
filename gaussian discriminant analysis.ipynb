    "GDA is an interesting classification method. Unlike those optimization-based models, it is a generative learning algorithm based on probabilities. It requires a stronger assumption than Logistic regression. To our surprise, Logistic does not require any distribution assumption, not even exponential family distribution. That's why we should always try Logistic first. \n",
    "\n",
    "The foundation of GDA is Bayes' theorem. Let's breakdown what each element means.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P (y \\mid x)=\\frac {P (x \\mid y) \\cdot P (y)} {P (x)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In a binary GDA, the assumption is that $x$ is always independent of $y$ which yields $P (x)=1$. $P (y)$ denotes the probability density function of Bernoulli distribution which is $P (y)=\\phi^{y}+(1-\\phi)^{1-y}$ where $\\phi$ specifies the portion of each label. $P (x \\mid y)$ denotes the probability density function of multivariate Gaussian distribution (because we assume it follows Gaussian distribution to use GDA). To make prediction, we merely compute the probability for each label and pick the label associated with the higher probability. It's literally a walk in the park.\n",
