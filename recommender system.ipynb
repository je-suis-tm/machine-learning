    "Recommender system is a system widely used in Amazon, Netflix to predict user rating for a given item. Usually the system involves collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, session-based filtering or even a mixture.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Collaborative filtering seeks connections across different users and items to predict the rating. It is more related to unsupervised learning. Even inside collaborative filtering, there are a few different techniques such as model-based (matrix factorization, latent variables), memory-based (KNN, KNN with z score) and even a hybrid of both. Collaborative filtering will be the main focus of this script. \n",
    "* Content-based filtering collects user and item profile. Based upon the features in the profile, it forecasts the user preference towards different items. It is more related to supervised learning.\n",
    "* Session-based filtering monitors the user interaction within a session to create recommendations. It is quite helpful to navigate through the cold start problem where a new user has not much available information for modelling. It is more related to deep learning, in particular, Recurrent Neural Network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a recommender system, not every customer rates every item so it effectively forms a partially filled customer vs item matrix. To recommend anything to the existing customer, a fully filled matrix must be inferred from the dataset. This falls into the spectrum of matrix completion. The most popular sub-problem of matrix completion is to find a low rank matrix via convex optimization (Candès and Recht, 2008). The sub-problem assumes there must be latent variables influencing the users and the items in the matrix. Thus, the matrix must be low rank.\n",

Conventionally people call it Funk SVD, although it is merely inspired by Singular Value Decomposition without explicitly using SVD. Funk SVD is really easy to implement and quick to converge with high accuracy. It is a type of collaborative filtering focusing on matrix factorization. The official optimization problem is formulated as below.\n",

    "To explain a bit, Funk SVD assumes that both user and item are affected by $m$ number of latent factors ($p_u \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}\\,\\&\\,q_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}$). These latent factors could be percentage of action in the movie, number of tier 1 hollywood stars, etc. The rating $r_{ui}$ is merely the linear combination $q_i^Tp_u$ of user preference and item attributes. This decomposition is similar to SVD in the form of $U\\Sigma V^T$ without the eigenvalue diagonal $\\Sigma$ as scaling factors. Hence, the first bit of the objective function is an ordinary least square to minimize the sum of squared error between existing rating and estimated rating. Since the matrix is partially filled, the second bit of the objective function is L2 norm regularization on user preference $p_u$, item attributes $q_i$, user deviation $b_u$ and item deviation $b_i$ to avoid overfit problem.\n",

It can be seen as an augmented Funk SVD with user implicit feedback. The accuracy is further improved at the cost of implicit feedback integration. The official optimization problem is formulated as below. The notations are almost the same with only a few extra from implicit feedback.\n",

    "To explain a bit, SVD++ incorporates user implicit feedback into the model. Users may have watched a lot of movies on Netflix yet they choose to rate items in $N(u)$ for a particular reason. For instance, user $u$ may have watched six seasons of House of Cards but he strongly resents the last season. Hence, he gives one star rating to the last season. This kind of implicit feedback is not captured in any latent factors. Nonetheless, the implicit feedback $y_j$ is not independent of any latent factors. Since certain combination $q_i^Tp_u$ triggers the user response and amplifies the extreme rating, $y_j$ is included in both the objective function and the constraint to avoid overfit problem. FYI, $y_j$ can be seen as another latent factor vector with the exact dimension as $q_i$.\n",

    "Before we talk about KNN with baseline, it is necessarily to talk about the baseline model. Even though we have given extensive coverage of baseline in Funk SVD, KNN does not really do any gradient descent. Thus, the baseline involved in KNN has to be estimated separately. The baseline model is formulated below. It is merely Funk SVD without latent factors.\n",

    "However, we intend to introduce another method called Alternating Least Square. The way it works is similar to coordinate descent. At each epoch, we estimate one parameter and fix the rest. The haute couture of ALS is its ability to estimate each parameter in parallel. It can execute a lot quicker than GD in high dimensional data. Another benefit is we do not need to tune the learning rate of GD. The derivation of ALS is formulated below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start to estimate $b_u$. The term $r_{ui}-\\mu-b_i$ can be considered as a constant $\\phi$. Yet, in a standard least square problem, the equation is in the form of $y=x \\cdot \\beta^T$. We have to assume $b_u$ follows the form of $b_u \\cdot I^T$.\n",

    "Now $b_u$ can be estimated from a Ridge Regression estimator. In our case, $I$ is a vector of ones. $b_u \\cdot I^T$ is an operation which repeats $b_u$ into the dimension of a full matrix $r$ (or $\\phi$). $I^T I$ is normally the length of vector $b_u$ (a scalar) but $r$ is an incomplete matrix so $I^T I$ denotes a vector that contains the number of users which rated item $i$. $I^T \\phi$ is merely the summation of $r_{ui}-\\mu-b_i$. Similarly, we define $\\psi=r_{ui}-\\mu-b_u$ and $H$ is a vector of ones. We can easily derive the update rule for $b_i$ as well.\n",
